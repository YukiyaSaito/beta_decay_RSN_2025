### Nuclear properties
- `{ }` (empty): FRDM based nuclear properties
- `reaclib`: Nuclear properties taken from the REACLIB library
- `reaclib+bdf` Nuclear properties taken from the REACLIB library, with beta-delayed fission supplemented with FRDM calculations

### Final abundance / reaction names
- `YA`: Final isotopic abundance pattern
- `beta`: Beta-decay
- `bdf`: Beta-delayed fission
- `nif`: Neutron-induced fission
- `spf`: Spontaneous fission
